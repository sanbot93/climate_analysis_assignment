# climate_analysis_assignment
This is my jupyter notebook adaptation for the course ENSC304-Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at Royal Roads University.

# About this script
This script works as a way to learn about python and accessing climate data for analysis. If you encounter bugs or issues throughout the script, please feel free to reach out or make the changes and do a pull request.

# Resources Used
This notebook was adapted from [the instructors orginal script](https://github.com/mbexhrs3/UCW-Project). Further aid from this tutorial was also used.
